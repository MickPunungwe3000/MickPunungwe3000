Hi there! 

üöÄ About Me

üéì I am Maverik Punungwe, a Full Stack Software Architect & Engineer (currently specializing in Digital Signage and Energy Conservation Applications). I am also building an AI powered Digital Signage Platform that will improve customer experience in health, finance and retail.

üë®‚Äçüíª I am really enthusiastic about learning new technologies. Recently, I learned Dart and Blockchain development.I also got started with Freelancing and Blogging quite recently and I am going to make a name for myself.

üé∏ Apart from software I am passionate about robotics,flight and rocketry. I am also constantly pushing myself to develop new skills. I play guitar, lift weights, write comic dialogues and play soccer.

üìö I also love reading books on personal development & financial literacy. My favorite ones are Unscripted by MJ DeMarco in the genre of personal development and Rich Dad Poor Dad by Robert Kiyosaki in the genre of financial literacy.

‚úàÔ∏è I love traveling too. I have been on solo trips to Zanzibar(2015), Kenya(2015) and Mozambique (2016).
