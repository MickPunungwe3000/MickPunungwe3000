# 👋 Hi there, I’m Maverik Punungwe

Welcome to my digital space.

I'm a **Full Stack Software Architect & Engineer** with 7 years of nonstop hands-on experience — mostly in **Java**, **Spring Boot**, and complex backend systems powering **Digital Signage**, **IoT**, and **Energy Conservation** solutions.

Currently, I’m building an **AI-powered digital signage platform** aimed at transforming user experiences across industries like **mining**, **agriculture**, **healthcare**, **finance**, and **retail**.

## 🚀 About Me

My journey began in **Electronic Engineering**, where I discovered my love for code and circuit design. Since then, I’ve written embedded code, architected distributed backend systems, and led dev efforts on the software behind South Africa’s top digital signage networks. If you’ve seen an LED billboard out here — there’s a solid chance my code is running behind it.

I’ve worked with:
- **Java + Spring Boot** for backend architecture
- **C#** and **C** for embedded and native integrations
- **Flutter** and **Kotlin/Dart** for mobile work
- **Queue systems, microservices, and streaming infrastructure** under real-world constraints

Outside of work, I’m a **hobbyist electronic engineer**, a **fitness nerd**, and a lifelong student of systems — software and otherwise.
